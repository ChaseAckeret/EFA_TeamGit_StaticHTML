        Household footwear comes in all shapes in sizes. There are shoes for jogging, slippers for chilly mornings, and then there are the boots. In general, one pair isn't enough. You end up needing polite company boots and some <b>soggy boots.</b>
        Because sometimes the only thing for it is to get out there in the muck. And that's where our very own Mr. Soggyboots the Third comes in. Never the perfect answer (because honestly, who wants their toes damp), but sometimes the right answer nonetheless.
